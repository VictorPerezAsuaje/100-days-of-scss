### 2nd Day - Interactive pricing component

<p>This one took me longer than the previous one (for obvious reasons I guess ðŸ˜‚). In this case I used Javascript to add interactions with the user, so the range can be activated and the values can change. The little switch right below also works and multiplies the original value by eight, so it "applies" the 20% discount.</p>

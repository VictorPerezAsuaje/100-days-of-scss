# 1st Day - Simple Hamburger Menu Animation

<p>The original challenge does not consider it an animation but an interactive button, as it would if I changed the animation from being activated by the "animation" property to an EventListener with Javascript (adding the class "active", for instance).  However, this was my approach. Maybe in the future I make a second version.</p>

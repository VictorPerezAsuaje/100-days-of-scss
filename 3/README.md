### 3rd Day - Interactive color picker

<p> Yesterday I was in a rush to complete this as I was also doing some tasks for the CSFP I'm in, so this was just barely finished on time ðŸ¤£</p>

<p>For this one, I also used Javascript to change the image according to the color selected and SASS animations.</p>

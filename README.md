# 100 days of (S)CSS challenge

Attempting the 100 days of (S)CSS by building 100 small projects using SCSS. The number 0 is the baseline I use for all projects, so they keep a certain consistency as specified in the following list:

- A title header
- A 300x300 pixels canvas
- An attribution paragraph at the bottom
- A gravatar
- Breakpoints (just in case)
- Color palette on SCSS variables (not mapped)
- Basic resets for margin, padding, font-family, etc.

Here you will see the whole list of projects done: http://todayilearned.eu/ 😄

### 1st Day - Simple Hamburger Menu Animation

<p>The original challenge does not consider it an animation but an interactive button, as it would if I changed the animation from being activated by the "animation" property to an EventListener with Javascript (adding the class "active", for instance).  However, this was my approach. Maybe in the future I make a second version.</p>

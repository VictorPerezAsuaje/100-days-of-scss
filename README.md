# 100 days of (S)CSS challenge

Attempting the 100 days of (S)CSS by building 100 small/simple projects using SCSS. The idea behind this is not just focusing on the CSS part - as some of them may also use Javascript to add a little bit of interactivity -, but to be disciplined, constant and try to work "under pressure" (time-schedule). 

**DISCLAIMER**: These projects are NOT tutorial-based. To make that would make no sense. I just take some images as references to copy, just like working with a web designer, they provide you the design to accomplish and you do your best to match it somehow.

The number 0 is the baseline I use for all projects, so they keep a certain consistency as specified in the following list:

- A title header
- A 300x300 pixels canvas that can be adapted to change the size depending on the project.
- An attribution paragraph at the bottom
- A gravatar
- Breakpoints (just in case)
- Color palette on SCSS variables (not mapped)
- Basic resets for margin, padding, font-family, etc.

However, I may use all or none depending on the situation. This is just made to save me some time as I'm usually only able to spend 3 hours on these projects tops.

### 1st Day - Simple Hamburger Menu Animation

<p>The original challenge does not consider it an animation but an interactive button, as it would if I changed the animation from being activated by the "animation" property to an EventListener with Javascript (adding the class "active", for instance).  However, this was my approach. Maybe in the future I make a second version.</p>

### 2nd Day - Interactive pricing component

<p>This one took me longer than the previous one (for obvious reasons I guess üòÇ). In this case I used Javascript to add interactions with the user, so the range can be activated and the values can change. The little switch right below also works and multiplies the original value by eight, so it "applies" the 20% discount.</p>

### 3rd Day - Interactive color picker

<p> Yesterday I was in a rush to complete this as I was also doing some tasks for the CSFP I'm in, so this was just barely finished on time ü§£</p>

<p>For this one, I also used Javascript to change the image according to the color selected and SASS animations.</p>

### 4th Day - Friends tribute cards

<p> I made this one because I was not really sure what I wanted to do today. However, I was seeing Friends - for the nth time - and I though "hey! Let's make a tribute to all the laughts I got from this series." And here it is üòÑ</p>

<p>Note: No Javascript was used for this prokect.</p>

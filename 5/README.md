### 5th Day - Digital Clock

<p> Who would have thought that a clock would be this challenging! This one certainly took me out of my confort zone and made me realize that there were still lots of things to learn. This time I had to research a little bit about the Date() function and how to work with svg, but there's still a long road ahead! That is a whole new world of possibilities I was not aware of, so it's pretty exciting ðŸ˜„</p>
